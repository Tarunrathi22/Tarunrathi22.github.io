>_An AI-Powered Image and Speech Recognition System_

### Project Overview
---
In this project, a Python-based image and speech recognition system will be developed.<br> The system will identify and categorize objects in images (such as people, cars, fruits, and other objects) using OpenCV and TensorFlow. <br>It will work in conjunction with ChatGPT to provide users with comprehensive details about the identified objects, which they can download as a PDF.<br> Prior to creating the PDF, users will have the option to modify the prompt.
